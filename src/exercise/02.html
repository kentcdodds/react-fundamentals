  <!-- 🐨 add React and ReactDOM on the page.
       💰 Here are script tags that'll do the job:
  -->
  <!-- NOTE: Basically, React is used to create elements -->
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@18.1.0/umd/react.development.js"></script>
  <!-- NOTE: Basically, ReactDOM is used to put those elements in the DOM.
  It is related to the platform, which in this case is the web, but there is also a
  ReactNative and ReactVR packages as well -->
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18.1.0/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>

  <!-- <script type="module">
    const rootElement = document.getElementById('root')

    // You're going to re-implement this code using React!
    // 💣 So go ahead and delete this implementation (or comment it out for now)
    // These three lines are similar to React.createElement
    const element = document.createElement('div')
    element.textContent = 'Hello World' // 💰 in React, you set this with the "children" prop
    element.className = 'container' // 💰 in React, this is also called the "className" prop

    rootElement.append(element)

    // with these React API calls

    // they can be astring or an array of elements. In fact, every argument after the second one
    // will be set into an array that will be the children of the element.
  
    // This could have been a third approach:
    // const reactElement = React.createElement(elementType, elementProps, 'Hello World!');
  
    // This could have been a fourth approach:
