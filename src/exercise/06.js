    // This event's type is SyntheticEvent, which is a wrapper around the native event created
    // by React for performance reasons. It has pretty much the same properties and methods
    // as the native event, but it's not the native event itself. To access the native event, 
    // you can use the event.nativeEvent property.

    const username = inputRef.current.value;
    // Third, access the value of the <input> by using the `current` property of your ref object
    // This is a React specific way to access the value of the <input> element.

    /**
     * After React creates the DOM node and puts it on the screen, React will set
     * the `current` property of your ref object to that DOM node.
     * Now you can access the <input>‚Äôs DOM node.
     * https://react.dev/reference/react/useRef#manipulating-the-dom-with-a-ref
     * 
     * The useRef Hook returns an object with a single property called current.
     * Initially, myRef.current will be null. When React creates a DOM node for this <div>,
     * React will put a reference to this node into myRef.current. You can then access this
     * DOM node from your event handlers and use the built-in browser APIs defined on it.
     * https://react.dev/learn/manipulating-the-dom-with-refs
     * 
     * By default, React does not let a component access the DOM nodes of other components.
     * Not even for its own children! This is intentional. Refs are an escape hatch that
     * should be used sparingly. Manually manipulating another component‚Äôs DOM nodes makes
     * your code even more fragile.
     * Instead, components that want to expose their DOM nodes have to opt in to that behavior.
     * A component can specify that it ‚Äúforwards‚Äù its ref to one of its children.
     * 
     * In design systems, it is a common pattern for low-level components like buttons, inputs,
     * and so on, to forward their refs to their DOM nodes. On the other hand,
     * high-level components like forms, lists, or page sections usually won‚Äôt expose
     * their DOM nodes to avoid accidental dependencies on the DOM structure.
     * https://react.dev/learn/manipulating-the-dom-with-refs#accessing-another-components-dom-nodes
     * 
     * Refs are an escape hatch. You should only use them when you have to ‚Äústep outside React‚Äù.
     * Common examples of this include managing focus, scroll position, or calling browser APIs
     * that React does not expose.
